When astronomical images are taken by Charged-Coupled Device (CCD) telescopes here on earth, plenty of corrections are necessary before the images are suitable for viewing. This process is named "reducing" and includes:

1. Bias Correction: removing the non uniform noise generated by the cameras electronics.
2. Dark Correction: removing the noise generated by the cameras thermals.
3. Flat Fielding Correction: normalising the brightness across the frame.
4. Sky Subtraction: removing the earth's atmosphere from the photograph.

The Python code here reduces images of neptune taken by the LaSilla-QUEST telescope stored in the QUESTdata folder, so that they are ready for viewing using a FITS file image viewing tool such as DS9.

Then by looking out for light sources changing position in the images taken, 5 of Neptune's moons were found. This was made easy by DS9's 'blink' technique which rapidly iterates through the three images, making Neptunes satellites easy to spot. The stitched images are viewable in the 'stitched_moons.png' file. A mini-report is available in the Y file.
