When astronomical images are taken by Charged-Coupled Device (CCD) telescope here on earth, plenty of corrections are necessary before the images are suitable for viewing. This process is named "reducing" and includes:

1. Bias Correction - removing the non uniform noise generated by the cameras electronics.
2. Dark Correction - removing the noise generated by the cameras thermals.
3. Flat Fielding Correction - Normalising the brightness across the frame.
4. Sky Subtraction - removing the earth's atmosphere from the photograph.

The Python code here reduces images of neptune taken by the LaSilla-QUEST telescope stored in the QUESTdata folder, so that they are ready for viewing using a FITS file image viewing tool such as DS9.
